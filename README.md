# my-latex-template
My collection of useful LaTex templates, modified from multiple shared templates. 

# What are these templates?
Currently, this repo contains templates for

1.  Project report (with support for code highlighting)
2.  Assignment (math and formulas)

And all of them support Chinese and English well.

# Why are these templates?
There are some criterion:

1.  Useful (for a university student)
2.  Pretty and elegant (mostly to my taste)
3.  Simple, unfancy

# License
Most templates here are collected from the Internet and I preserve their original license and authors' info in these files.
